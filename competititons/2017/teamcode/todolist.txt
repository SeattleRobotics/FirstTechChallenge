Future changes and cleaning up:
    $$ Color sensor - clean up, make callable from other classes
    $$ Jewel arm - put in all code
    $$ autocore - program (make sure to measure distances and come up with accurate algorithms to take in sensor data and get cubes)
    $$ core - add more functionality, currently is pretty useless (think of some things that could be moved there)
    inputSensor - program (like the input file for core, but for autocore and with sensors)
    [See about phone training software]
    [see about proximity sensor]
    [figure out way to implement color sensor for cube borders]
    [come up with working automatic period algorithm]
    [CLEAN UP CODE (i.e. useless imports)]
